Team Wikis
----------

The team wikis will serve as a repository for the research and brainstorming that different teams and their individual members are doing. Team members can use their team wikis to share their work with each other, as well as contribute to one other's work. Each student should contribute to the team wiki to document their individual progress in the class, as well as share ideas and resources with their team members. We expect each team member to have at least one major contribution to the team wiki each week during the entire semester.

An important part of research is proper documentation and attribution. When you present a fact, a graphic, or an opinion that is not your own on a Web site, in a presentation slide, or in a paper, you must reference it properly. Correct referencing is not often part of a high-school curriculum, so you should familiarize yourself with the correct approach, Consult [Chapter 10](http://www.mhhe.com/mayfieldpub/tsw/csxlr.htm) of the online version of the _Mayfield Handbook of Technical and Scientific Writing_ for a brief treatment of this subject. We will use the [American Psychological Association (APA) citation style](http://www.mhhe.com/mayfieldpub/tsw/doc-apa.htm) for this class.

Each team is responsible for proposing one or more components of the final Mission 2013 design. By mid-October, each team must upload to the class wiki a draft version of their finished research and proposals. This work should be presented in considerable detail, and it will serve as an informational resource when the entire class decides on the final proposed plan. These documents should have a solid, professional look and it should be informative to anyone who might read it from outside the Mission 2013 community. Again, information and ideas must be properly cited.

Class Wiki
----------

The class wiki will, at a larger scale, serve the same purpose as the team wikis. As the transition from team-based research to class-based solution occurs, the class wiki will serve as a place for the students to share files, as well as comment and contribute to each other's work. The students will use this space to communally finalize the documents from which the Project Web Site will be created.

Project Web Site
----------------

One of the major assignments for the semester is the development of a coherent, highly informative description of the final Mission 2013 solution in the form of a Project Web Site. This will be your opportunity to provide a succinct review of the principal components of your overall solution and to describe your implementation strategy in detail.

One effective approach to constructing a good site is for each team to designate a delegate to a Project Web Site committee, which will meet regularly throughout November. The final Project Web Site must be fully operational by the end of November.

For the Project Web Site, it is not enough to list what will be done; rather, you must explain how you arrived at your final solutions. In other words, you must justify your decisions with facts and reasoning. In doing this you should clearly illustrate not just your final solutions, but the thought process that you followed. What alternative solutions did you consider and ultimately reject? Why did you reject them? What was the logic behind selecting certain alternatives? Who did you consult, and how did their opinions influence your decisions?

General Web Site Design Tips
----------------------------

There are so many really cool things to do on web pages that it is easy to get carried away, but it is important to realize that on a Web site purported to provide information, too many special effects will dilute your message. Remember that the focus of your Web sites is content, not flash! Try to create sites that are not cluttered but will let your message come through loud and clear. Just as on your computer screen, the user interface should be easily understandable and intuitive, yet fade into the background so that it doesn't overpower the content.
